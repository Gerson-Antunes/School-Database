# School-Database
Relational database design and SQL implementation for a school management system using ERD and normalization principles.

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a normalized relational database for a school management system. The database models relationships between schools, students, teachers, subjects, and subject enrolments, ensuring data integrity through primary and foreign keys. SQL scripts include table creation, data insertion, and test queries. The project showcases practical database design concepts such as entity-relationship modeling, referential integrity, and structured query testing.
